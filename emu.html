      "Ã„re you sure? is that a bird?" Emu is considered the second tallest bird according to the researches and it is also one of those birds with a very high speed just like an ostrich.
			It is was a very shocking moment when I realised that the emu was actually facing it's back towards me yet it's head is twisted completelyin the same direction.
			It took more than 3 minutes for me to realize that thing to be honest. No matter what, these are one of the very prestegious birds to the country of Australia
