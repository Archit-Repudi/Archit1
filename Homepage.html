	 	<p>The Astralian Wildlife is a very vast topic to discover. The count of fauna reciding in Australia is extremely high. <br> For the people
 		who love spending their time with animals, Australia could be their paradise... <br>
 		The relationship between the Australians and the fauna is quite inspiring. The way people respect their fauna is something everybody needs to learn and respect...</p>
